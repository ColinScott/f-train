# F-Train

Uses [Eff](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff) to control model railways. You should probably use something like [JMRI](http://jmri.org/) which has actual features and works with the hardware you have.

## Why

There are a number of software packages out there that can work with DCC gear. I am bringing another one into the world to learn Eff. If you are not me you should almost certainly use something else.
